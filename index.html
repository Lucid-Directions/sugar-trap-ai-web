      <h1>SugarTrap AI - Why Do You Crash at 3PM Every Day?</h1>
      <p>Your "healthy" breakfast might be the culprit. See the hidden glucose spikes behind every meal before you feel the crash. The AI-powered glucose prediction app that reveals your metabolic patterns.</p>
      
      <h2>The Problem: The Glucose Rollercoaster You Can't See</h2>
      <p>Modern science has revealed that how your body responds to food matters far more than simple calorie counting. Every meal triggers a complex hormonal response that affects your energy, mood, focus, and long-term health. Until now, this information was only available through expensive medical testing.</p>
      
      <h2>How SugarTrap AI Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Snap Any Meal</strong> - Take a photo or scan a barcode. Our AI instantly identifies ingredients and portions with remarkable accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Get Full Analysis</strong> - Receive complete nutritional breakdown including calories, macros, and micronutrients for traditional tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Glucose Prediction</strong> - See your predicted blood sugar response curve and understand exactly how this meal will affect your energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimise & Learn</strong> - Get science-backed suggestions to optimise any meal for stable, lasting energy and better health outcomes.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Key Problems We Solve</h2>
      <h3>Energy Crashes</h3>
      <p>That "healthy" breakfast might be spiking your blood sugar higher than dessert. Blood sugar spikes from high-glycemic foods cause rapid insulin release, leading to subsequent crashes that leave you feeling drained and craving more sugar. How SugarTrap AI helps: Predicts your personal glucose response to any meal, helping you choose foods that provide sustained energy.</p>
      
      <h3>Brain Fog</h3>
      <p>Your 3pm energy crash isn't about willpower, it's about biology. Your brain consumes 20% of your daily glucose, making it sensitive to blood sugar fluctuations. How SugarTrap AI helps: Maintain stable glucose for mental clarity and cognitive performance.</p>
      
      <h3>Stubborn Weight</h3>
      <p>Those pounds aren't just about calories in vs. calories out. Insulin is a powerful fat-storage hormone; frequent spikes keep your body in "storage mode" regardless of total calorie intake. How SugarTrap AI helps: Choose foods that keep insulin stable and hunger hormones balanced.</p>

Modern research reveals why traditional one-size-fits-all approaches fail, and how personalized nutrition science is revolutionizing health. Key areas include insulin sensitivity optimization, circadian metabolism, gut microbiome influence, sleep and metabolic health, exercise and glucose dynamics, and stress hormone management.</p>
