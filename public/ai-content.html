  <h1>Why Do You Crash at 3PM Every Day?</h1>
  <p>Your "healthy" breakfast might be the culprit. See the hidden glucose spikes behind every meal before you feel the crash.</p>
  <p>The AI-powered glucose prediction app that reveals your metabolic patterns.</p>

  <!-- Problem/Explanation -->
  <h2>Why Traditional Nutrition Tracking Falls Short</h2>
  <p>You've been told to count calories. Watch your portions. Exercise more. But what if the real key to sustained energy and health has been <strong>invisible all along?</strong></p>

  <h3>The Glucose Rollercoaster You Can't See</h3>
  <p>Modern science has revealed that <strong>how your body responds to food</strong> matters far more than simple calorie maths. Every meal triggers a complex hormonal response that affects your energy, mood, focus, and long-term health. Until now, this information was only available through expensive medical testing.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>40% — Lower glucose spike with proper food combinations</li>
    <li>70% — Reduction in energy crashes with optimised meals</li>
    <li>10x — More predictive than calorie counting alone</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Energy Crashes</h3>
  <p>That "healthy" breakfast might be spiking your blood sugar higher than dessert.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blood sugar spikes from high-glycemic foods cause rapid insulin release, leading to subsequent crashes that leave you feeling drained and craving more sugar.</li>
    <li>Glucose variability—the ups and downs of blood sugar—is more predictive of energy crashes than absolute levels.</li>
    <li>Identical meals can cause 10x different glucose responses between individuals.</li>
    <li>The timing of crashes often coincides with productivity dips at work (the 3pm slump).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>How SugarTrap AI helps:</strong> Predicts your personal glucose response to any meal, helping you choose foods that provide sustained energy.</p>

  <h3>Brain Fog</h3>
  <p>Your 3pm energy crash isn't about willpower, it's about biology.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your brain consumes 20% of your daily glucose, making it sensitive to blood sugar fluctuations; when glucose drops after a spike, cognitive function declines.</li>
    <li>Glucose variability correlates with reduced working memory, slower processing speed, and difficulty concentrating.</li>
    <li>The hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to glucose swings.</li>
    <li>People with higher glucose variability score lower on cognitive tests, even with normal average glucose.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>How SugarTrap AI helps:</strong> Maintain stable glucose for mental clarity and cognitive performance.</p>

  <h3>Stubborn Weight</h3>
  <p>Those pounds aren't just about calories in vs. calories out.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Insulin is a powerful fat-storage hormone; frequent spikes keep your body in "storage mode" regardless of total calorie intake.</li>
    <li>Different glycemic index foods can produce vastly different weight outcomes even with identical calories.</li>
    <li>High glucose variability disrupts hunger and satiety signaling (ghrelin/leptin).</li>
    <li>200 calories of almonds affects your body differently than 200 calories of white bread.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>How SugarTrap AI helps:</strong> Choose foods that keep insulin stable and hunger hormones balanced.</p>

  <h3>Hidden Patterns</h3>
  <p>The glucose rollercoaster you can't see is controlling your day.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Glucose levels fluctuate with meals, stress, sleep, and activity—these changes are invisible without monitoring.</li>
    <li>Morning patterns cascade through the entire day, affecting energy, meals, and sleep.</li>
    <li>The same person can respond differently to the same meal at different times based on metabolic state.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>How SugarTrap AI helps:</strong> Predicts your glucose response before you eat, making the invisible visible.</p>

  <h2>The Science of Personal Nutrition</h2>
  <p>Everyone's glucose response is as unique as their fingerprint. Modern research reveals why traditional one-size-fits-all approaches fail, and how personalized nutrition science is revolutionizing health.</p>

  <h3>Interactive Science Demos</h3>
  <h4>Insulin Sensitivity Simulator</h4>
  <p>Insulin sensitivity determines how effectively your cells respond to insulin. Higher sensitivity means better glucose control and stable energy levels. This simulation shows how different sensitivity levels affect your glucose response to the same meal.</p>

  <h4>Circadian Metabolism Clock</h4>
  <p>Your body follows natural circadian rhythms that affect insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and metabolism. Morning typically shows highest insulin sensitivity, declining through the day. This is why timing meals matters for metabolic health.</p>

  <!-- Science topics (from ScienceHub) -->
  <h3>Key Science Topics</h3>
  <h4>Optimal Insulin Sensitivity</h4>
  <p>Understanding how your body efficiently manages blood sugar with minimal hormonal intervention.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Optimal insulin sensitivity requires 2-10x less insulin than insulin-resistant states</li>
    <li>Stable glucose levels correlate with 25% improvement in cognitive function</li>
    <li>Muscle glucose uptake can improve by 30-50% with proper conditioning</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Compensatory Hyperinsulinemia</h4>
  <p>When your pancreas works overtime to overcome cellular resistance — the hidden precursor to diabetes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Can persist for 10-15 years before diabetes onset</li>
    <li>Beta-cell function declines by 4-5% annually once hyperinsulinemia begins</li>
    <li>Early intervention can reverse insulin resistance in 60-80% of cases</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Circadian Metabolism</h4>
  <p>How your internal clock orchestrates metabolism and why meal timing matters as much as meal content.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Glucose tolerance varies by 30% throughout the day</li>
    <li>Late-night eating disrupts circadian insulin sensitivity</li>
    <li>69% of population experiences social jet lag affecting metabolism</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Fat Metabolism: Debunking Decades of Myths</h4>
  <p>Modern research reveals why saturated fats aren't the cardiovascular villains once believed.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No significant association between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease in 78 studies (650,000 people)</li>
    <li>Higher omega-6 intake linked to 12% lower cardiovascular mortality</li>
    <li>Only 15% of blood cholesterol comes from diet, 85% produced by liver</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Gut Microbiome &amp; Glucose Control</h4>
  <p>How trillions of microorganisms in your gut influence blood sugar and metabolic health.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Microbiome contributes up to 10% of host energy extraction</li>
    <li>SCFA production from fiber directly stimulates GLP-1 release</li>
    <li>Fecal microbiota transplant can improve insulin sensitivity by 20%</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Sleep &amp; Metabolic Health</h4>
  <p>Why one night of poor sleep can make you temporarily pre-diabetic.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>One night of sleep deprivation reduces insulin sensitivity by 25-30%</li>
    <li>Sleep debt accumulates metabolic dysfunction over time</li>
    <li>Deep sleep stages are critical for glucose homeostasis</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Exercise &amp; Glucose Dynamics</h4>
  <p>How different types of exercise create distinct glucose responses and long-term adaptations.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>High-intensity exercise can improve insulin sensitivity for 48+ hours</li>
    <li>Resistance training builds glucose-disposing muscle mass</li>
    <li>Exercise timing relative to meals dramatically affects glucose clearance</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Stress Hormones &amp; Blood Sugar</h4>
  <p>How chronic stress creates a perfect storm for insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Chronic stress increases visceral fat accumulation by 45%</li>
    <li>Cortisol directly impairs insulin signaling pathways</li>
    <li>Stress management can improve HbA1c by 0.5-1.0%</li>
  </ul>
